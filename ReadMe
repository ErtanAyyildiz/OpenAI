OPEN AI

Description
This project demonstrates the use of C# programming language to implement an application that leverages various design patterns and OpenAI libraries to generate images and provide language-based responses to user questions. The key features of this project include:

Implementation of an IoC (Inversion of Control) layer: The application follows the IoC principle, allowing for loosely coupled and easily testable components.

Repository Pattern: The project employs the Repository Pattern to abstract data access and provide a consistent interface for interacting with the underlying data store. This improves maintainability and separation of concerns.

Unit of Work Pattern: The Unit of Work Pattern is used to manage database transactions and ensure data consistency across multiple repository operations.

Image Generation with OpenAI: The project utilizes OpenAI libraries to generate images based on user input or other relevant data. This feature enables the application to create custom images programmatically.

Language-based Question-Answering: The project incorporates OpenAI's language models to process user questions and generate responses in the programming language of your choice. This capability enhances the interactivity and usefulness of the application.
